My Rust Learning Journey

Welcome to my Rust learning journey. This document captures what I have learned and my progress as I explore the Rust programming language.
Why Rust?

Rust is a fast, memory-safe language that many developers appreciate. I am learning Rust to improve my skills in building efficient and reliable software.
What I Have Learned So Far

    Setting up a Rust project

    Writing and running the “Hello, world!” program

    Understanding the main function and macros like println!

    Compiling Rust code and how it works

    Using the command line to manage Rust projects

My Goals

    Understand Rust’s ownership and borrowing concepts

    Build safe and concurrent programs

    Create real-world projects and contribute to open source

    Learn error handling and lifetimes

    Explore Rust’s tools such as Cargo and crates

Why I Like Rust

    Safe concurrency without fear of data races

    Efficient code with no extra runtime cost
