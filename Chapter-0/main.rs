 // ?Hello World program

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

/*
    ? The main function (fn main() {}) is the starting point of every executable Rust program.

    ? Function bodies in Rust are enclosed in curly brackets ({}), and itâ€™s good style to place the opening bracket on the same line as the function declaration.

    ? Code formatting is standardized with a tool called rustfmt, which is included with Rust.

    ? The line println!("Hello, world!"); prints text to the screen by calling a macro (note the exclamation mark).

    ? Macros (like println!) use ! and are different from ordinary functions.

    ? Most lines in Rust end with a semicolon (;).
